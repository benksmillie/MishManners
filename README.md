## Hey everyone, I'm Mish Manners, AKA the Hackathon Queen 👋

<!--**MishManners/MishManners** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Everyday I get to create awesome experiences and engage with the vibrant GitHub developer community. I've run many hackathons, and am an accomplished MC, speaker, and facilitator :microphone:. You'll often catch me at an event or speaking on stage!

:zap: I have an electric scooter company, so check it out over on [Raine Scooters](http://raine.co).

I'm super into sports, including lots of outdoors adventures like hiking, snowboarding, and wakeboarding.
